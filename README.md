## About me
I'm an economics student at Trinity College Dublin with a keen interest in machine learning and its real-world applications. I love exploring the intersection of economics and technology, and how machine learning can be used to tackle multi-layered problems in the real world. I'm very interested in how machine learning and data analysis can be used to uncover patterns and insights about something as complicated as financial markets, that would be invisible to the naked human eye.  


I availed of free online resources such as Harvardx's computer science and artificial intelligience courses which I couldn't recommend enough, to first learn how to code in Python and C, and the fundamentals of many more. I have experience with scikit-learn, tensorflow, matplotlib, pandas, numpy and other well-known python libraries.
